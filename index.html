              Florence Nightingale (12 May 1820 - 13 August 1910) was an English
              social reformer, statistician and the founder of modern nursing.
              Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and
              trainer of nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised
              care for wounded soldiers at Constantinople. She significantly
              reduced death rates by improving hygiene and living standards.
              Nightingale gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an
              icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona of "The Lady
              with the Lamp" making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.

            Florence Nightingale (12 May 1820 - 13 August 1910) was
            an English social reformer, statistician and the founder of modern
            nursing. Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager

            Florence inherited a liberal-humanitarian outlook from both sides of
            her family.Her parents were William Edward Nightingale, born William
            Edward Shore (1794-1874) and Frances ("Fanny") Nightingale (née
            Smith; 1788-1880). William's mother Mary (née Evans) was the niece
            of Peter Nightingale, under the terms of whose will William
            inherited his estate at Lea Hurst, and assumed the name and arms of
            Nightingale. Fanny's father (Florence's maternal grandfather) was
            the abolitionist and Unitarian William Smith.[13] Nightingale's
            father educated her

            Determined to pursue her true calling despite her parents'
            objections, in 1844, Nightingale enrolled as a nursing student at
            the Lutheran Hospital of Pastor Fliedner in Kaiserwerth, Germany.

        <ul class="py-4">
          <li>
            Florence Nightingale's most famous contribution came during the
            Crimean War, which became her central focus when reports got back to
            Britain about the horrific conditions for the wounded at the
            military hospital on the Asiatic side of the Bosporus, opposite
            Constantinople, at Scutari (modern-day Üsküdar in Istanbul). Britain
            and France entered the war against Russia on the side of the Ottoman
            Empire.
          </li>
          <li>
            On 21 October 1854, she and the staff of 38 women volunteer nurses
            including her head nurse Eliza Roberts and her aunt Mai Smith,
            and 15 Catholic nuns (mobilised by Henry Edward Manning) were
            sent (under the authorisation of Sidney Herbert) to the Ottoman
            Empire. On the way, Nightingale was assisted in Paris by her friend
            Mary Clarke.The volunteer nurses worked about 295 nautical
            miles (546 km; 339 mi) away from the main British camp across the
            Black Sea at Balaklava, in the Crimea.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nightingale arrived at Selimiye Barracks in Scutari early in
            November 1854. Her team found that poor care for wounded soldiers
            was being delivered by overworked medical staff in the face of
            official indifference. Medicines were in short supply, hygiene was
            being neglected, and mass infections were common, many of them
            fatal. There was no equipment to process food for the patients.

        <ul class="py-4">
          <li>
            In the Crimea on 29 November 1855, the Nightingale Fund was
            established for the training of nurses during a public meeting to
            recognise Nightingale for her work in the war. There was an
            outpouring of generous donations. Sidney Herbert served as honorary
            secretary of the fund and the Duke of Cambridge was chairman. In her
            1856 letters she described spas in the Ottoman Empire, detailing the
            health conditions, physical descriptions, dietary information, and
            other vital details of patients whom she directed there. She noted
            that the treatment there was significantly less expensive than in
            Switzerland.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nightingale wrote Notes on Nursing (1859). The book served as the
            cornerstone of the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other
            nursing schools, though it was written specifically for the
            education of those nursing at home. Nightingale wrote, "Every day
            sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words,
            of how to put the constitution in such a state as that it will have
            no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher
            place.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notes on Nursing also sold well to the general reading public and is
            considered a classic introduction to nursing. Nightingale spent the
            rest of her life promoting and organising the nursing profession. In
            the introduction to the 1974 edition, Joan Quixley of the
            Nightingale School of Nursing wrote: "The book was the first of its
            kind ever to be written. It appeared at a time when the simple rules
            of health were only beginning to be known, when its topics were of
            vital importance not only for the well-being and recovery of
            patients, when hospitals were riddled with infection, when nurses
            were still mainly regarded as ignorant, uneducated persons. The book
            has, inevitably, its place in the history of nursing, for it was
            written by the founder of modern nursing"
